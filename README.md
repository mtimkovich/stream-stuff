# TextApp

Create a simple GUI that displays text from a text file, rereading the file every couple seconds. Good for Twitch Studio, which doesn't support that yet.

## Usage

Modify the `config` dictionary with your desired settings.

## Status

* I've only tested this on Windows, but it could be patched to work with other OSes without too much effort.
* Requires a little Python knowledge to use. Should create a `.exe` that reads from a config file instead.
